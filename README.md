Project description:
Who's ready to leave? Criminal edition. Prisoners are often released on parole for good behaviour, but some immediately commit crimes and return to prison. The percentage of prisoners who return (within a short time window) is called the recidivism rate. Your goal is to help the government understand which inmates are likely to commit a subsequent crime, and which inmates are ready for parole. Your solution must not discriminate on the basis of a protected class, such as race, sex, or national origin
